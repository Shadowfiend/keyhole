h1. Keyhole

Keyhole is a library that allows you to create interactive tutorials on a web
page using a script in JS. Its main purpose is to leverage the Raphael.js
library to allow you to focus attention on a particular element on the page.

More to come.

h2. Deploying

A version of raphael.js is included here, but it is the un-minified version and
is intended to simplify development. In production, consider deploying
Raphael.js separately and minified.
